## Introduction üóíÔ∏è

As a developer, I'm passionate about honing in on my skills to create engaging projects - this extends beyond creating web apps, as I feel the same way about creating music, games and artwork.

## Pages üìú

_The portfolio is divided into several pages, each with its own focus:_

**Web Apps** üì¶

- The web apps page provides an overview of the web apps I've created. Each app is accompanied by a brief description as well as a video demo, and you can easily access the project's GitHub and Live links.

**Projects** üé®

- On the projects page, you can explore some of my side projects, which include game development and music composition. Each project is accompanied by a brief description and a screenshot or video.

**Contact** ‚úâÔ∏è

- If you'd like to get in touch, the contact page provides a simple form where you can send me a message. I'm always happy to hear from fellow developers, potential collaborators, or anyone with an interest in my work.

## Tools Used üîß

_Here are some of the tools I used to create this portfolio:_

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap Icons
- Astro
  - Astro provides a great and highly optimized workflow for creating static sites - since this site is just a portfolio for showcasing work, I chose to use it.
- React
  - I used React with several components for which I wanted to include state management, the main ones being the **Navigation Bar** and **Contact Form**. I also used it for simple components that take props - each article for my **web apps** and **projects** are react components.
- Tailwind CSS
  - I like Tailwind CSS as it simplifies the process for creating page layouts - you can also configure it with custom colors and other properties.
- AOS / Animation on Scroll
  - This is a very simple **npm** library that makes scroll animations smooth and easy to set up.
- Netlify
  - Netlify is a great, free method for hosting a front-end site.

Thank you for checking out my portfolio! I hope you enjoy exploring my projects and learning more about my work.
